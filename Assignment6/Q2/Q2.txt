Q2. Write two differences between ArrayList and LinkedList.
    1. ArrayList is a data structure that uses a dynamic array to store elements,
        while LinkedList is a data structure that uses a linked list to store elements.

    2. Getting and setting data with ArrayList is faster than with LinkedList, since
        ArrayList uses index to position the data, while LinkedList iterates each element
        so it is more time consuming.
