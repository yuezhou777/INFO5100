    Q10. What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction
        
        Both Encapsulation and Abstration are hiding information from users, however, encapsultion is 
        used to hiding coding detail and data in order to protect data from being altered. Abstraction
        is used to hiding irrelevant data in order to extract common features of objects.

        For example, All cameras can take picture, and they all have a lens. Although some cameras have 
        digital screens and some not, we focus on the picture-taking feature and lens, this is what 
        abstration does. The complex mechanism of how camera works is hidden from users, who only need 
        to press shutter to take photos, this is how encapsulation works.
