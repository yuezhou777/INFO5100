    Q9. Explain Encapsulation with an example. (Write at least 30-40 words).

        Encapsulation hides the complexity of an object and provides a simple operational entry to visitors
        of that object. The camera is an example of encapsulation. The working mechanism of the camera is
        very complicated, but users of camera do not have to understand its working mechanism, they only need
        to press the shutter to take pictures.

        Encapsualtion helps to keep data in an object safe from being tampered. In the example of camera, 
        if all the parts and components are exposed to users, the camera is easy to be damaged since users 
        may interfere its parts.

        Encapsulation allows code to be reused, just like a camera can be used in many scenarios. 
        If we need to make some improvement on camera, we only need to revise the data within the camera class. 
        Users class do not need to make make any change to benefit from this change.
