Explain the difference between final and finally in Java 8.

Final is a keyword that modifies class, method and variable.
Final variable cannot be changed once initialized.
Final method cannot be overriden.
Final class cannot be inherited.

Finally is a block that used to catch different types of exceptions.
Finally block will be executed after try and catch blocks, and will 
be executed no matter the exception is thrown or not.
